Create an ultra-realistic image of Pikachu from Pokémon, bursting out of a Pikachu GX card. The Pikachu GX card should look glossy and vibrant, but the Pokémon illustration area on the card is faded, empty, or blurred—so the only clear Pikachu in the image is the one breaking free in 3D, surrounded by brilliant sparks, arcs of electricity, and glowing energy.Use dramatic lighting and meticulous details to make Pikachu look lively and dynamic as it emerges from the card, with the focus on its energetic pose and the crackling electric effects around it.
